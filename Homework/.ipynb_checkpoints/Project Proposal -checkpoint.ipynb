    "A project I would be interested in exploring is the US Debt Ceiling. I would like to learn more about what the debt ceiling is and what impacts it has on the US Economy. I am curious how other economic indicators show a relationship with the debt ceiling too. I think this is an interesting project to look into because it is very topical and would be a good experience for me in building my programming skills. "
